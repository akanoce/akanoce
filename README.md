## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm Erik Nucibella, a Software Engineer specialized in Fullstack Web Development 
### I work as a freelancer often handling projects from the design and implementation to the deploy, but i also integrate in mid-size teams managed by PMs.
### With a strong passion for programming, i exploit the skills acquired over the years to develop my own project and ideas.
### For two years, i've been particularly interested in personal finance and financial markets, digging deep into subjects like investing, trading and risk management. I am therefore skilled and interest in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance, developing and backtesting hundreds of algos, which led to the creation of a web based platform that allow to create and backtest strategies written via a python code-editor, that will be the base of my own robo-advisory service
